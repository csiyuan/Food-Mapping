# Food-Mapping

🍰 Food Mapping | Culinary Discovery Platform A CMS-driven exploration tool for food enthusiasts and brand discovery.
📌 Project Overview Food Mapping is a high-end "Brand Discovery" platform designed to showcase culinary experiences through a structured, visual-first interface. Unlike a simple recipe blog, this project focuses on the mapping of flavors and brands, allowing users to navigate through curated food collections managed via a headless CMS.
🛠️ Tech Stack Frontend: React / Next.js
Content Management: Headless CMS (Contentful / Sanity / Strapi)
Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first responsive design)
Animations: Framer Motion (For smooth transitions between food categories)
Deployment: Vercel / AWS
✨ Key Features
1. Headless CMS Integration The core of this project is its decoupled architecture. By using a CMS, the platform allows for:
Real-time content updates without redeploying code.
Structured data schemas for "Food Brands," "Locations," and "Flavor Profiles."
2. Brand Discovery Engine Designed specifically for "Brand Discovery," the UI helps users filter and find new culinary experiences.
Dynamic Filtering: Sort by cuisine, price point, or brand identity.
Visual-Heavy UX: High-resolution optimized imagery to drive user engagement.
3. Bento-Style Architecture Following the design language of my portfolio, the "Food Mapping" UI uses a Bento Grid layout to present data in a clean, organized, and modern way—ensuring the "cheesecake" (and other content) is the hero of the page.
🎨 Design Philosophy The aesthetic is "Minimalist Gourmand." * Clean Typography: Uses whitespace to let the food photography stand out.
Responsive Precision: Optimized for mobile users who discover food "on the go."
Interactive Cards: Custom hover states and micro-interactions that provide a premium, tactile feel.
🚀 Performance Metrics Lighthouse Score: Aiming for 90+ across SEO and Performance.
Image Optimization: Utilizing Next/Image for WebP conversion and lazy loading to handle high-res food photography without lag.
💡 The "Interviewer" Insight The Challenge: Handling a large volume of high-resolution images while maintaining a fast "Time to Interactive." The Solution: I implemented a robust CMS-to-Frontend pipeline that fetches only the necessary metadata on initial load, using blur-up placeholders to ensure the UI feels fast and responsive even on slower connections.
